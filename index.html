      <p>I've worked in many feels trying to find my feet but never enjoyed what I did, I found myself gravitating towards computers constantly and enjoyed learning about them and learning how programs worked and what made them tick. I enjoyed helping people with their computer issues and have always been interested in coding, although my knowledge base was very limited at the time. Web Development and coding is something I thought I would get a lot of satisfaction out of, as well as expand and grow as a person within the field.</p></td>
